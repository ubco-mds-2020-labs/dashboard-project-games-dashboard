## Done so far
We experimented with a first iteration of the dashboard, which went live on Heroku before we became aware that the dimensionality of our data allowed for more complexity, and we scrapped the first attempt, aside from the sidebar, and went with a more sophisticated 3-tab layout, separating different points of view on the data.
Added some more information to the readme so it could be more informative.

## To do
There are issues with the loading times, and we are missing extra plots to fill in the empty spaces (because we had a smaller number of plots previously).
We are also planning to add new filters for each of our 4 categories and give the alternative of aggregating all regions.

## Limitations
The underlying data is very limited, as it doesn't allow us to view more recent information or sales numbers in currency, only in units sold.
If time permits we could connect to the API for live updates on this.
