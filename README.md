## Motivation
Videogames are no longer an incipient industry but a well established field of entertainment, but its similarities and differences with other mediums makes them hard to understand people outside of it, including investors, media, and other laypersons. Understanding the underlying information on why the market evolves across time the way it does in different regions, platforms and genre facilitates understanding the mechanics and cultural differences that push this industry forward.

This dashboard's purpose is to help the viewer understand the reality of the videogame market with as much detail as possible, down to the individual title sales numbers. It includes the composition of historical videogame sales from 1980 to 2020, according to their genre (Roleplaying, Strategy, Action, etc.), console (PlayStation, Xbox, PC, etc.) and region (Europe, Asia, North America, etc.).

## Description
The Games Dashboard includes bar charts, scatter plots and violin plots which are all color coded to better convey their message and compare to each other. They are all adjustable to the preferred point of view of the user, including a slider to adjust the visualized date range and dropdown lists to allow the user to filter for the region, platform and genre of interest. (i.e. Nintendo sales between 1990 and 2000 for action games) A list shows the top seller titles for the selected filters, with a summary of their information, and a selector allows the user to show more or less titles on this table.

The Games Dashboard includes visualizations and widgets to help the user understand the industry.
